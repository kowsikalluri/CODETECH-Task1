# CODETECH-Task1
# Overview of the Project

*Project:* LINEAR REGRESSION ON HOUSING PRICES

*Name:* A chandana kowsik

*Company:* CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS  

*ID:* CT8ML1392  

*Domain:* Machine Learning 

*Duration:* June to August 2024

*Mentor:* SRAVANI GOUNI  

## Objective

The objective of this project is to perform Multi Linear Regression on a dataset containing house pricing data .Each record in the database describes a Boston suburb or town. The data was drawn from the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1970. This is a project to improve skills in the field of regression models. The purpose of the project is as follows:

- Intuitive data analysis
- Data preprocessing  
- Learning the concepts of test and training data  
- Using the correlation criterion to detect the relationship between variables  
- Learning the concepts of simple linear regression , multivariate regression and Forward and Backward Stepwise Regression  
- Learning the concepts of collinearity, correlation between errors, non-constant variance of errors, high leverage point  
- Improve coding skills

## Key Activities

- *Data Cleaning:* Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistencies and missing values.
- *Data Visualization:* Creating visualizations to understand data distributions, trends, and relationships.
- *Data Splitting:* Partitioning the dataset for training and testing purposes.

## Technologies Used

- *Python:* The primary programming language for data analysis.
- *pandas:* Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- *matplotlib:* Employed for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- *seaborn:* Utilized for making statistical graphics that are informative and attractive.
